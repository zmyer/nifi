    	<p>
    		QueryRecord provides users a tremendous amount of power by leveraging an extremely well-known
    		syntax (SQL) to route, filter, transform, and query data as it traverses the system. In order to
    		provide the Processor with the maximum amount of flexibility, it is configured with a Controller
    		Service that is responsible for reading and parsing the incoming FlowFiles and a Controller Service
    		that is responsible for writing the results out. By using this paradigm, users are not forced to
    		convert their data from one format to another just to query it, and then transform the data back
    		into the form that they want. Rather, the appropriate Controller Service can easily be configured
    		and put to use for the appropriate data format. 
    	</p>
    	
    	<p>
    		Rather than providing a single "SQL SELECT Statement" type of Property, this Processor makes use
    		of user-defined properties. Each user-defined property that is added to the Processor has a name
    		that becomes a new Relationship for the Processor and a corresponding SQL query that will be evaluated
    		against each FlowFile. This allows multiple SQL queries to be run against each FlowFile.
    	</p>
    	
    	<p>
			The SQL syntax that is supported by this Processor is ANSI SQL and is powered by Apache Calcite. Please
			note that identifiers are quoted using double-quotes, and column names/labels are case-insensitive.
